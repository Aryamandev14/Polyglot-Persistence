Here’s a sample `README.md` for your **Polyglot Persistence** project:

---

# 🧠 Polyglot Persistence Project

This project demonstrates a modern **Polyglot Persistence** architecture by integrating **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, **MongoDB**, and **Neo4j** into a single full-stack application. Each database is used for what it does best, optimizing both performance and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 1. **User Signup – PostgreSQL**

* When a new user signs up, their details are stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.
* PostgreSQL is used here for its robustness in handling structured relational data with strong consistency.

### 2. **User Login & Session Management – Redis**

* Upon login, a new session is created and stored in **Redis**, a fast in-memory key-value store.
* When the user logs out, the session is destroyed, making Redis ideal for lightweight and efficient session management.

### 3. **Product Management – MongoDB**

* Users can add new products via the dashboard UI.
* These products are stored in **MongoDB**, which is ideal for handling flexible, schema-less, and hierarchical product data.

### 4. **Purchase Tracking – Neo4j**

* When a user purchases a product, a **relationship** is created between the `User` and the `Product` node in **Neo4j**, representing graph-based connectivity.
* This allows advanced relationship queries like **who bought what**, **product recommendations**, etc.

## 🧪 Functional Flow

```
[User Signup] ---> PostgreSQL

[User Login] ---> Redis (creates session)
   ↓
[Dashboard Screen]
   ↳ Add Product ---> MongoDB
   ↳ Buy Product ---> Neo4j (connects User → Product)
   
[User Logout] ---> Redis (ends session)
```

---

## 📦 Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/polyglot-persistence-app.git
cd polyglot-persistence-app

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Environment setup
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in database connection strings

# Run services (if using Docker)
docker-compose up

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## 📊 Example Queries

* 🔍 Get all products added by a user (MongoDB):

```js
db.products.find({ createdBy: "userId" })
```

* 🔁 Get products bought by a user (Neo4j Cypher):

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)-[:BOUGHT]->(p:Product) WHERE u.id = "userId" RETURN p
```

* 🧠 Check active sessions (Redis CLI):

```bash
GET session:<userId>
```
